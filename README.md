This tool will give you some information about your league of legends accounts and store them in a text file.

### How to use?

To add accounts, open the Accounts window and then, you can add a single account or you can import a text file with your account's username & password in the following formats:

username:password

Then, click on **Start** to start checking. Your accounts will start appearing in the Dashboard, and if they don't, click on the Accounts window (Where you imported the accounts from) and look at the state of the account. You can also stop whenever you want, and then click **Start** again if you wanna resume!
 
You can also import and export checked accounts that you want to see later.
